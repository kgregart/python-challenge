## Instructions

Create Python scripts to analyze two different scenarios:  1. The PyBank script calculates values to analyze financial records and 2. The PyPoll script will help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

### 1. PyBank

Develop a Python script that analyzes the budget_data.csv dataset to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### 2. PyPoll

![PyPoll](https://github.com/kgregart/python-challenge/blob/main/Images/Vote_counting.png)

Develop a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values using the election_data.csv dataset:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
