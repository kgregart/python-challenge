## Instructions

Create Python scripts to analyze two different scenarios:  1. The PyBank challenge delivers a script that calculates values to analyze financial records and 2. The PyPoll challenge helps a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

### PyBank

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
