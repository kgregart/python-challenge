## Instructions

Create Python scripts to analyze two different scenarios:  1. The PyBank challenge delivers a script that calculates values to analyze financial records and 2. The PyPoll challenge helps a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

### PyBank

Develop a Python script that analyzes the budget_data.csv dataset to calculate each of the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
